#  Calculator Project at Jotform

I coded the calculator ui design project, my second internship project at Jotform, which I started as a UI Developer intern.

While coding the design, I did not use a ready-made CSS library such as bootstrap and only designed it using display properties.

The screen output of the Calculator ui design is as in the image below.
